# textbook-solutions
Solutions to the tasks from a book "Cracking the Coding Interview". I wrote them in high school.
File name that looks like a.b.c.py means that the file contains the solution number c to a task number b from a chapter number a. I left two solutions only if I thought that both of them worked.
